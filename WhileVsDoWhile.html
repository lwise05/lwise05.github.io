    <h1>When would you use while vs do while loops?</h1>

    <p><strong>While</strong> loops allow us to execute code multiple times for as long as condition is true but the condition is checked <em>before</em> executing the code. This means the loop can execute 0 or more times. <strong>Do while</strong> loops checks the condition <em>after</em> executing the code, which means that the code will execute at least once before deciding if it will execute again.</p>
    <p>The benefit of a <strong>do while</strong> loop is that it will always execute ATLEAST once.
